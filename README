Dreamweaver

Dreamweaver is a script to install and configure a fresh Debian installation with my daily-use desktop.

Usage

1. Clone the repository:

	`git clone https://github.com/h3nc4/Dreamweaver.git`

2. Run the script:

	`Dreamweaver/install`

Flags

The script accepts the following optional flags:

- `-o`: Include optional packages in the installation.
- `-d`: Install development packages.
- `-g`: Install gaming-related packages and allow proprietary software.
- `-v`: Set up virtualization tools (e.g., QEMU, KVM).
- `-m <mirror>`: Specify a custom Debian or Devuan mirror URL. If omitted, the script defaults to `http://deb.debian.org/debian/` or `http://deb.devuan.org/merged/`

Main Contents

- `install`: The main script for installation and configuration. Covers all setup steps.
- `config/packages.csv`: A CSV file listing the packages to install.
- `config/bash/`: Bash configuration files used in the setup.
- `config/profile.d/`: Scripts to be sourced by the user's profile.
- `utils/`: Contains auxiliary scripts for installing and configuring specific applications.

Usage Notes

- If running on Devuan, use the `-m` flag to specify a Devuan mirror. Otherwise, the script defaults to a Debian mirror.
- For optimal security, use this script on an encrypted system. The setup includes enabling auto-login and passwordless privileges.
